.. Sphinx-Preview documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Mon Dec  6 11:07:59 2021.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Sphinx-Preview
==============
``Sphinx-Preview`` shows small previews for selectable links in HTML documents.

Example:

* ``Sphinx-Preview`` is a `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ extension.
* It is maintained by `danwos <https://daniel-woste.de>`_
* And it may be helpful to get quick previews, e.g. of
  `Sphinx-Needs <https://sphinxcontrib-needs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ objects

  * :need:`REQ_001`.
  * :need:`SPEC_001`.

``Sphinx-Preview`` does not provide any rst directives or roles, as it detects automatically all links via
JavaScript.

But there is a bunch of configuration options to control behavior and style.

.. warning::

   This project is in beta-phase.
   Support for Firefox seems to work well. Chromium based browsers  have some problems with some specific pages in
   iframes (jumping page, no navigation to given anchor).

Showcase
--------
.. image:: /_static/sphinx-preview-showcase.gif
   :align: center

Test yourself here: :ref:`needs`.

iframe handling
---------------
The iframe preview gets opened by mouseover and/or by clicking the icon (if ``icon_click = True``).
It gets closed, if the mouse leaves the link/icon. And it also gets closed, if the mouse leaves the iframe.

So as long as the mouse stays on the link/icon, the iframe window is open.

If you want to navigate inside the iframe, you should use ``icon_click = True``.
In this case  the mouse can leave the icon and the iframe stays open.
Another click on the icon will close the iframe, or if the mouse leaves the iframe (after entering it once).

iframe position is also not fix. If the iframe window will be outside the current browser screen, the position and
maybe size are recalculated, so that it fits on the screen.

Please take also into account, that mobile devices do not have a mouse. For them ``icon_click = True`` is the best
configuration to let them open the preview window.

Configuration
-------------
``Sphinx-Preview`` provides a single configuration option, called ``preview_config``.
This must get a Python dictionary:

.. code-block:: python

   # conf.py

   preview_config = {
       "selector": "div.body a",
       "not_selector": "div.needs_head a, h1 a, h2 a",
       "set_icon": True,
       "icon_only": True,
       "icon_click": False,
       "icon": "  üëÅ",
       "width": 500,
       "height": 400,
       "offset": {
           "left": 20,
           "top": 20
       },
       "timeout": 500,
   }

selector / not_selector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Takes a `jQuery selector <https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/>`_ to define which
links shall be taken into account.

``selector`` cares about all found elements. And ``not_selector`` defines, which links shall not be handled.

The internal javascript call looks like this:

.. code-block:: javascript

   $(config.selector).not(config.not_selector).each(function () {
     // some internal voodoo
   })

So ``selector`` can be used to select all links inside the main container, e.g. ``div.body``, and
``not_selector`` may be used to remove all links inside ``h1`` or ``h2``.

Default values:

:selector: ``div.body a``
:not_selector: ``h1 a, h2 a, h3 a, h4 a, h5 a, div.needs_head a``

Examples

| **Alabaster - preview for internal links only**
| selector: ``div.body a.reference.internal``

   examples/needs
   changelog

set_icon
~~~~~~~~
If ``set_icon`` is ``True``, an icon will be added at the end of the link.

Default: ``True``

icon_only
~~~~~~~~~
If ``True``, only the icon will open the preview.
The link itself stays "normal" and will not open a preview window.

Default: ``True``

icon_click
~~~~~~~~~~
The icon behaves like a button:

1. click, preview window gets opened
2. click, preview window is closed.

No more mouseover affects for the icon.

Best solution, if preview window shall be used also on mobile devices.

Default: ``False``

icon
~~~~
Defines the icon or better a string.

Use Utf-8 icons to get some nice "images".

Default: ``üëÅ``

width
~~~~~
Width of the preview window in `px`.

Default: ``500``

height
~~~~~~
Height of the preview window in `px`.

Default: ``300``

offset
~~~~~~
Takes a dictionary with the keys ``left`` and ``top``.
Both values define in ``px`` the location of the preview window, relative to the starting position of the link.

Default::

   {
       'left': 20,
       'top': 20
   }


timeout
~~~~~~~
A time in ``ms``, after which the preview window gets shown.

Default: ``250``.
